## Usage üîó

To start your journey with Cyberyen Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Cyberyen Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `cyberyen-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `cyberyen-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Ports

Cyberyen Core by default uses port `58383` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `58382` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   58383 |   44551 |   18440 |
| RPC      |   58382 |   44550 |   18439 |
